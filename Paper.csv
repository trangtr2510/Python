The causal agent of sticky disease was identified as an isometric virus with a double stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome, named papaya meleira virus (PMeV). In the present study, PMeV dsRNA and a second RNA band of approximately 4.5 kb, both isolated from latex of papaya plants with severe symptoms of sticky disease, were deep-sequenced. The nearly complete sequence obtained for PMeV dsRNA is 8,814 nucleotides long and contains two putative ORFs; the predicted ORF1 and ORF2 display similarity to capsid proteins and RdRp's, respectively, from mycoviruses tentatively classified in the family Totiviridae. The sequence obtained for the second RNA is 4,515 nucleotides long and contains two putative ORFs. The predicted ORFs 1 and 2 display 48% and 73% sequence identity, respectively, with the corresponding proteins of papaya virus Q, an umbravirus recently described infecting papaya in Ecuador. Viral purification in a sucrose gradient allowed separation of particles containing each RNA. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that both PMeV and the second RNA virus (named papaya meleira virus 2, PMeV2) were encapsidated in particles formed by the protein encoded by PMeV ORF1. The presence of both PMeV and PMeV2 was confirmed in field plants showing typical symptoms of sticky disease. Interestingly, PMeV was detected alone in asymptomatic plants. Together, our results indicate that sticky disease is associated with double infection by PMeV and PMeV2.\n""]",The dsRNA Virus Papaya Meleira Virus and an ssRNA Virus Are Associated with Papaya Sticky Disease,6.0883636

There is a critical need to identify potential new viral pathogens and the challenge is to identify the reservoirs from which these viruses might emerge. Deep sequencing of invertebrate transcriptomes has revealed a plethora of viruses, many of which represent novel lineages representing both plant and animal viruses and little is known about the potential threat that these viruses pose. Methods: Providence virus, an insect virus, was used to establish a productive infection in Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) plants. Providence virus particles purified from these cowpea plants were used to infect two mammalian cell lines. Findings: Here, we present evidence that Providence virus, a non-enveloped insect RNA virus, isolated from a lepidopteran midgut cell line can establish a productive infection in plants as well as in animal cells. The observation that Providence virus can readily infect both plants and mammalian cell culture lines demonstrates the ability of an insect RNA virus to establish productive infections across two kingdoms, in plants and invertebrate and vertebrate animal cell lines. Conclusions: The study highlights the potential of phytophagous insects as reservoirs for viral re-assortment and that plants should be considered as reservoirs for emerging viruses that may be potentially pathogenic to humans.

These interactions can be positive or negative and can occur at multiple scales, from coinfection of a cell to co-circulation at a global population level. For influenza A viruses (IAVs), the delivery of multiple viral genomes to a cell substantially increases burst size. However, despite its relevance for IAV evolution through reassortment, the implications of this positive density dependence for coinfection between distinct IAVs has not been explored. Furthermore, the extent to which these interactions within the cell shape viral dynamics at the level of the host remains unclear. Here we show that, within cells, diverse coinfecting IAVs strongly augment the replication of a focal strain, irrespective of their homology to the focal strain. Coinfecting viruses with a low intrinsic reliance on multiple infection offer the greatest benefit. Nevertheless, virus-virus interactions at the level of the whole host are antagonistic. This antagonism is recapitulated in cell culture when the coinfecting virus is introduced several hours prior to the focal strain or under conditions conducive to multiple rounds of viral replication. Together, these data suggest that beneficial virus-virus interactions within cells are counterbalanced by competition for susceptible cells during viral propagation through a tissue. The integration of virus-virus interactions across scales is critical in defining the outcomes of viral coinfection.\nAuthor summary: The co-occurrence of distinct virus populations within a single host occurs commonly, when an individual acquires a second infection before a prior one has been cleared. Under these circumstances, each virus can influence the replication of the other, positively or negatively. These interactions can involve viruses of different species but here we focus on interactions between distinct influenza A viruses (IAVs). For IAVs, coinfection is important to viral evolution and emergence because it can result in the formation of novel, chimeric viruses. We find that two IAVs infecting the same cell often interact synergistically, such that replication is improved compared to a singular infection. Conversely, when monitoring viral dynamics within a mammalian model, we see that virus-virus interactions at the level of the whole host are antagonistic. Our data suggest that, when viruses are propagating through a population of cells, beneficial interactions within cells are counterbalanced by competition for susceptible target cells. This antagonistic interaction is likely a major factor limiting the formation of chimeric IAVs during coinfection.

However, viral genomics continues to suffer due to difficulties related to the isolation and characterization of uncultivated viruses. We report here on a new approach called ‘Single Virus Genomics’, which enabled the isolation and complete genome sequencing of the first single virus particle. A mixed assemblage comprised of two known viruses; E. coli bacteriophages lambda and T4, were sorted using flow cytometric methods and subsequently immobilized in an agarose matrix. Genome amplification was then achieved in situ via multiple displacement amplification (MDA). The complete lambda phage genome was recovered with an average depth of coverage of approximately 437X. The isolation and genome sequencing of uncultivated viruses using Single Virus Genomics approaches will enable researchers to address questions about viral diversity, evolution, adaptation and ecology that were previously unattainable.\n      ']",Single Virus Genomics: A New Tool for Virus Discovery,5.9279613

Rapid, accurate, and consistent interpretation of generated data is thereby of fundamental concern. Ontologies–structured, controlled, vocabularies–are designed to support consistency of interpretation, and thereby to prevent the development of data silos. This paper describes how ontologies are serving this purpose in the COVID-19 research domain, by following principles of the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry and by reusing existing ontologies such as the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Core, which provides terminological content common to investigations of all infectious diseases. We report here on the development of an IDO extension, the Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO), a reference ontology covering viral infectious diseases. We motivate term and definition choices, showcase reuse of terms from existing OBO ontologies, illustrate how ontological decisions were motivated by relevant life science research, and connect VIDO to the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO). We next use terms from these ontologies to annotate selections from life science research on SARS-CoV-2, highlighting how ontologies employing a common upper-level vocabulary may be seamlessly interwoven. Finally, we outline future work, including bacteria and fungus infectious disease reference ontologies currently under development, then cite uses of VIDO and CIDO in host-pathogen data analytics, electronic health record annotation, and ontology conflict-resolution projects.\n']",Coordinating virus research: The Virus Infectious Disease Ontology,5.9279613

One unanswered question is how infection is controlled and cleared during a dengue infection. Antibody is thought to play a role, but little past work has examined the kinetics of both virus and antibody during natural infections. We present data on multiple virus and antibody titres measurements recorded sequentially during infection from 53 Vietnamese dengue patients. We fit mechanistic mathematical models of the dynamics of viral replication and the host immune response to these data. These models fit the data well. The model with antibody removing virus fits the data best, but with a role suggested for ADCC or other infected cell clearance mechanisms. Our analysis therefore shows that the observed viral and antibody kinetics are consistent with antibody playing a key role in controlling viral replication. This work gives quantitative insight into the relationship between antibody levels and the efficiency of viral clearance. It will inform the future development of mechanistic models of how vaccines and antivirals might modify the course of natural dengue infection.\nAuthor Summary: Dengue is a globally important viral disease. Despite this, there is still much unknown about the immunology, virology and epidemiology of dengue. As for all viral infections, the interaction between virus and immune response is a complex one. Using data collected from patients, we model how the virus replicates in an infected individual and how the human antibody response acts to control that replication. We show that the timing and magnitude of the growth and decline of virus and antibody levels in dengue-infected patients are consistent with antibody playing a key role in controlling infection. Our results are of use in the evaluation of potential antiviral drugs and vaccines.

Because of the bond between the two viruses, control measures for HBV may have also affected the spread of hepatitis D, as evidenced by the decline of hepatitis D in recent years. Since the presence of hepatitis D is associated with suppressed HBV replication and possibly infectivity, it is reasonable to speculate that hepatitis D may facilitate the control of HBV. Methodology and Principal Findings: We introduced a mathematical model for the transmission of HBV and hepatitis D, where individuals with dual HBV and hepatitis D infection transmit both viruses. We calculated the reproduction numbers of single HBV infections and dual HBV and hepatitis D infections and examined the endemic prevalences of the two viruses. The results show that hepatitis D virus modulates not only the severity of the HBV epidemic, but also the impact of interventions for HBV. Surprisingly we find that the presence of hepatitis D virus may hamper the eradication of HBV. Interventions that aim to reduce the basic reproduction number of HBV below one may not be sufficient to eradicate the virus, as control of HBV depends also on the reproduction numbers of dual infections. Conclusions and Significance: For populations where hepatitis D is endemic, plans for control programs ignoring the presence of hepatitis D may underestimate the HBV epidemic and produce overoptimistic results. The current HBV surveillance should be augmented with monitoring of hepatitis D, in order to improve accuracy of the monitoring and the efficacy of control measures.

NS5A comprises three domains, of these domain I is believed to be involved exclusively in genome replication. In contrast, domains II and III are required for the production of infectious virus particles and are largely dispensable for genome replication. Domain I is highly conserved between HCV and related hepaciviruses, and is highly structured, exhibiting different dimeric conformations. To investigate the functions of domain I in more detail, we conducted a mutagenic study of 12 absolutely conserved and surface-exposed residues within the context of a JFH-1-derived sub-genomic replicon and infectious virus. Whilst most of these abrogated genome replication, three mutants (P35A, V67A and P145A) retained the ability to replicate but showed defects in virus assembly. P35A exhibited a modest reduction in infectivity, however V67A and P145A produced no infectious virus. Using a combination of density gradient fractionation, biochemical analysis and high resolution confocal microscopy we demonstrate that V67A and P145A disrupted the localisation of NS5A to lipid droplets. In addition, the localisation and size of lipid droplets in cells infected with these two mutants were perturbed compared to wildtype HCV. Biophysical analysis revealed that V67A and P145A abrogated the ability of purified domain I to dimerize and resulted in an increased affinity of binding to HCV 3’UTR RNA. Taken together, we propose that domain I of NS5A plays multiple roles in assembly, binding nascent genomic RNA and transporting it to lipid droplets where it is transferred to Core. Domain I also contributes to a change in lipid droplet morphology, increasing their size. This study reveals novel functions of NS5A domain I in assembly of infectious HCV and provides new perspectives on the virus lifecycle.\nAuthor summary: Hepatitis C virus infects 170 million people worldwide, causing long term liver disease. Recently new therapies comprising direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), small molecule inhibitors of virus proteins, have revolutionised treatment for infected patients. Despite this, we have a limited understanding of how the virus replicates in infected liver cells. Here we identify a previously uncharacterised function of the NS5A protein–a target for one class of DAAs. NS5A is comprised of three domains–we show that the first of these (domain I) plays a role in the production of new, infectious virus particles. Previously it was thought that domain I was only involved in replicating the virus genome. Mutations in domain I perturb dimer formation, enhanced binding to the 3’ end of the virus RNA genome and prevented NS5A from interacting with lipid droplets, cellular lipid storage organelles that are required for assembly of new viruses. We propose that domain I of NS5A plays multiple roles in virus assembly. As domain I is the putative target for one class of DAAs, our observations may have implications for the as yet undefined mode of action of these compounds.

In pigs, infection resulted in a predominantly non-lethal respiratory disease; however, infection in humans resulted in over 100 deaths. Nipah virus has continued to re-emerge in Bangladesh and India, and person-to-person transmission appeared in the outbreak. Although a number of NiV vaccine studies have been reported, there are currently no vaccines or treatments licensed for human use. In this study, we have developed a recombinant measles virus (rMV) vaccine expressing NiV envelope glycoproteins (rMV-HL-G and rMV-Ed-G). Vaccinated hamsters were completely protected against NiV challenge, while the mortality of unvaccinated control hamsters was 90%. We trialed our vaccine in a non-human primate model, African green monkeys. Upon intraperitoneal infection with NiV, monkeys showed several clinical signs of disease including severe depression, reduced ability to move and decreased food ingestion and died at 7 days post infection (dpi). Intranasal and oral inoculation induced similar clinical illness in monkeys, evident around 9 dpi, and resulted in a moribund stage around 14 dpi. Two monkeys immunized subcutaneously with rMV-Ed-G showed no clinical illness prior to euthanasia after challenge with NiV. Viral RNA was not detected in any organ samples collected from vaccinated monkeys, and no pathological changes were found upon histopathological examination. From our findings, we propose that rMV-NiV-G is an appropriate NiV vaccine candidate for use in humans.\n      ']",Recombinant Measles Virus Vaccine Expressing the Nipah Virus Glycoprotein Protects against Lethal Nipah Virus Challenge,5.7699313
